## [3.15.0] - 2026-02-07
### Added
- 📦 **Single Archive Encryption**: When selecting multiple files/folders, they are now automatically bundled into a **single encrypted archive** (`Encrypted_Archive_TIMESTAMP.tar.encrypted`).
    - Simplifies sharing: Send just one file instead of many.
    - Preserves file structure inside the encrypted package.
- 🛠️ **UX Improvement**: Removed the previous behavior of encrypting each file individually in batch mode.

## [3.14.0] - 2026-02-07
### Added
- 📂 **Folder Support**: Fully implemented folder encryption. Folders are automatically archived (`.tar`) and encrypted.
- 🖱️ **Context Menu**: "Right-Click -> Encrypt" now works for both files and folders.
- 📦 **Batch Encryption**: Support for selecting multiple files/folders and encrypting them in a single batch operation.

## [3.13.0] - 2026-02-07
### Added
- 🐛 **AES Visualization Fix**: CLI AES visualization now shows full detailed rounds (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey), matching Serpent's detail level.
- ℹ️ **Improved Help**: CLI help message is now cleaner and 100% English.

## [3.12.0] - 2026-02-07
### Added
- 👁️ **CLI Visualization**: Added visual mode (`--verbose` or `-v`) to the CLI.
    - Displays real-time encryption logs in the terminal.
    - Shows Serpent/AES rounds, keystream generation, and XOR operations.
    - Ideal for educational use and auditing.

## [3.11.0] - 2026-02-07
### Added
- 💻 **CLI Mode**: New `simple-encryptor-cli` tool included in the package.
    - Full encryption/decryption support via terminal.
    - Automation-friendly.
    - Usage: `simple-encryptor-cli -e file -p password --algo SERPENT`

## [3.10.0] - 2026-02-07
### Optimized
- 🚀 **Extreme Performance**: Replaced pure Python Serpent implementation with system `libgcrypt` calls.
- ⚡ **Speedup**: Serpent encryption speed increased from ~2 MB/s to **~300 MB/s**.
- 👁️ **Accurate Visualization**: Visual log now displays the actual keystream generated by `libgcrypt` and `cryptography` (AES).

### Fixed
- 🐛 **Log Sync**: Fixed discrepancy between visual log (simulation) and actual file processing.
- 📦 **Dependencies**: Updated `.deb` package to depend on `libgcrypt20`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-06
### Added
- 🌍 **English Localization**: Complete translation of UI and logs.
- 🐍 **Serpent Cipher**: Added Serpent-256 algorithm support.
- 🔒 **Authenticated Encryption**: Implemented CTR mode + HMAC-SHA256 for Serpent.
- 🛡️ **AES-GCM**: Migrated from AES-CBC to AES-GCM for authenticated encryption.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-06
### Added
- �️ **Deep Vision**: Detailed inspection mode for AES rounds.
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Migration to `CustomTkinter`.
- � **Progress Bar**: Real-time progress visualization.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-06
### Initial Release
- ✨ Basic GUI (Tkinter).
- 🔒 AES-256-CBC Encryption.
- 🔑 PBKDF2 Key Derivation.
- 📦 Debian Package (.deb).
