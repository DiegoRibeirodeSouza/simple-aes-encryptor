Description: SafeSign Identity Client (Bundled)
 This package includes the proprietary SafeSign Identity Client
 driver (libaetpkss) bundled with necessary legacy libraries
 (libtiff5, libwxgtk3.0, etc.) that are no longer available
 in Debian 13 / Ubuntu 24.04.
 .
 It installs legacy libs to /opt/safesign/lib to avoid system conflicts.
